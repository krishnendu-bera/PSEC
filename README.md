# PSEC
Extract protein sequence and calculate charge from PDB files

# PDB Sequence Extractor & Charge Calculator (PSEC)
PSEC is a Python-based user-interactive script designed for processing Protein Data Bank (PDB) files. It extracts protein sequences from PDB structures and calculates the net charge of biomolecules based on their amino acid composition. It can also handle post translation modifications (PTMs) while calculating the charges.

Key Features:
✅ Sequence Extraction – Retrieves amino acid sequences from PDB structures.
✅ Charge Calculation – Computes the net charge of proteins considering standard protonation states.
✅ PDB Cleaning – Removes non-standard residues and extracts relevant structural information.
✅ Easy to Use – Lightweight script with minimal dependencies, designed for computational biochemistry workflows.

# Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Biopython: Install via `pip install biopython`
- Matplotlib: Install via `pip install matplotlib`
- Requests: Install via `pip install requests`

# Usage

python PSEC.py
