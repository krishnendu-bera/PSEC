# PSEC
Script to extract protein sequence and calculate charge from PDB files

# PDB Sequence and Charge Calculator

This script extracts the protein sequence from a PDB file, cleans the structure to remove non-standard residues, and calculates the charge of the protein at a specified pH. It also generates a plot of charge versus pH and saves the results in a FASTA file and a charge information file.

# Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Biopython: Install via `pip install biopython`
- Matplotlib: Install via `pip install matplotlib`
- Requests: Install via `pip install requests`

# Usage

python PSEC.py
